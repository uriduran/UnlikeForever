# UnlikeForever

 Have you ever gotten in trouble for liking something on facebook that you probably shouldnt have? 
 
 Truth is we now live in a world where double taps and likes carry more social meaning than they really should, so in order to help you not like things (whether by **accident** or against **better judgement**) I've created this extension that completely removes the ability to like things on facebook.

## Tell me how to install before I get in trouble!

I will be submitting this extension to the Chrome App Store in the future (once I figure out how to) so unfortunately you'll have to follow 2 extra steps when installing this.
