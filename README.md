# UnlikeForever

 Have you ever gotten in trouble for liking something on facebook that you probably shouldnt have? 
 
 Truth is we now live in a world where double taps and likes carry more social meaning than they really should, so in order to help you not like things (whether by **accident** or against **better judgement**) I've created this extension that completely removes the ability to like things on facebook.

## Tell me how to install before I get in trouble!

I will be submitting this extension to the Chrome App Store in the future (once I figure out how to) so unfortunately you'll have to follow 2 extra steps when installing this.

First it is important to know that this extension only works on the **Chrome Browser**

1. Navigate to https://github.com/uriduran/UnlikeForever although you probably already are here. On the top right in bright green where it says "Clone or Download" go ahead and click it then click **Download ZIP** 
2. Once downloaded go ahead and unzip it. You should now have a normal folder called "UnlikeForever-master" with things inside containing files called manifest, styles, and README. Keep this folder handy.
3. Open Chrome, which it probably already is. 
4. Type this into your search bar **chrome://extensions/** This should take you to the Extensions tab in Chrome.
5. Now go back to the folder "UnlikeForever-master" and drag it into the Chrome extensions page you opened in **step 4**.

The extension should now be installed. Make sure to drag the entire folder **not** just the three files inside.

Go to facebook.com or reload it if you are already there. You should now have no "Like" button.

You're welcome world.
